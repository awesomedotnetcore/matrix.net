**What is a microservices application?**

A microservice architecture is an architectural style and a product development approach for developing a single application as a suite of independently deployable smaller services which are built around individual business capabilities, each running in its own process and communicating using lightweight neutral mechanisms.

**Why this is a microservices application?**

Matrix.NET is an abstraction and functional grouping of common functionalities for a generic application which is designed and developed in microservices architectural style. This contains a suite of independently deployable services such as registry, directory, configurator, journal and postman which are build around distinct business capabilities of an application such as manifest, users, user groups, user roles, configuration settings, debug logs and external communication such as email and phone text messages.
